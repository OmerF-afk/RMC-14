reagent-name-rmcphoron = Phoron
reagent-desc-rmcphoron = A special form of metallic plasma that is not found on Earth. While phoron is highly flammable and extremely toxic, its high energy density makes it one of the best solid fuel alternatives. Liquid phoron is often used for research purposes and in the medical industry a catalyst to many advanced chemicals.

reagent-name-rmcnapalmut = UT-Napthal Fuel
reagent-desc-rmcnapalmut = Known as Ultra Thick Napthal Fuel, a sticky combustible liquid chemical, typically used with flamethrowers.

reagent-name-rmcnapalex = Napalm EX
reagent-desc-rmcnapalex = A sticky combustible liquid chemical made up of a combonation of rare and dangerous reagents both that penetrates the best fire retardants, and burns extremely hot.

reagent-name-rmcnapalx = Napalm X
reagent-desc-rmcnapalx = A sticky combustible liquid chemical that burns extremely hot.

reagent-name-rmcnapalb = Napalm B
reagent-desc-rmcnapalb = A special variant of napalm that's unable to cling well to anything, but disperses over a wide area while burning slowly. The composition reacts with inorganic materials to ignite them, causing severe damage.
